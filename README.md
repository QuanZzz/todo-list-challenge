## Todo List Challenge

Create a simple todo list based on what is already stubbed out inside `routes/TodoList.js` with the following functionality:
- Add a form to add a simple "todo" item. E.g., "Water the lawn", "Get a better pencil",
- Add a button alongside each added todo item to be able to remove it from the list.

The goal is to simply be able to add and remove items from a basic todo list. Feel welcome to add/edit anything in the project to suit your needs.

No need to include any server-side integration, no persisted state required (no Redux).

## Project Setup

Clone the repo and setup locally using `yarn install`.

Run the app locally using `yarn start`.

View the app locally at `http://localhost:3000/`.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
